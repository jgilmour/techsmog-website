        <h1>PermitReady Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="effective-date"><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 1, 2025</p>

        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>PermitReady is an educational app that helps teenagers study for their driver's permit exam. We built this app with privacy in mind—especially for teen users and their parents. This policy explains what information we collect (spoiler: not much!) and how we handle it.</p>

        <h2>The Short Version</h2>
        <div class="summary-box">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>We don't collect your personal information.</strong> No names, emails, phone numbers, or accounts.</li>
                <li><strong>Your study progress stays on your device.</strong> We don't have servers or databases.</li>
                <li><strong>We show ads</strong> through Google AdMob (unless you purchase the ad-free version).</li>
                <li><strong>That's basically it.</strong></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>What We Collect</h2>

        <h3>Information Stored on Your Device</h3>
        <p>All your study data stays right on your phone or iPad. We use Apple's SwiftData to save:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Quiz scores and history</li>
            <li>Study streaks</li>
            <li>How well you're doing in each category</li>
            <li>Which state you selected</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>This information never leaves your device.</strong> We don't upload it anywhere, and we can't see it.</p>

        <h3>Information We Don't Collect</h3>
        <p>We want to be clear about what we <em>don't</em> do:</p>
        <ul class="no-collect-list">
            <li>We don't collect names, emails, or phone numbers</li>
            <li>We don't have user accounts or logins</li>
            <li>We don't use analytics or tracking services</li>
            <li>We don't collect your location</li>
            <li>We don't track you across apps or websites</li>
            <li>We don't use cookies or tracking pixels</li>
            <li>We don't have servers or databases storing your info</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Advertising</h2>

        <h3>Google AdMob</h3>
        <p>We display ads through Google AdMob to keep the app free. When you see an ad, Google may collect:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Device identifiers</li>
            <li>IP address</li>
            <li>Information about how you interact with ads</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This information is used by Google to show you ads and to limit how often you see the same ad. We don't control what Google collects—they operate under their own privacy policy.</p>
        <p><strong>Learn more:</strong> <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Privacy Policy</a></p>

        <h3>Removing Ads</h3>
        <p>You can purchase the ad-free version for $1.99 (one-time purchase). This is processed entirely through Apple's App Store. We never see your payment information—Apple handles everything. We only store a simple yes/no flag on your device to remember that you've removed ads.</p>

        <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
        <p>Our $1.99 ad-free purchase is handled by Apple. Here's what that means:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Apple processes the payment, not us</li>
            <li>We never receive your credit card or payment details</li>
            <li>We only store a local flag on your device indicating your purchase</li>
            <li>No payment information is ever sent to us</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Learn more:</strong> <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple Privacy Policy</a></p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>PermitReady is designed for teenagers aged 15-17 learning to drive. Our app:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Is rated 4+ (appropriate for all ages)</li>
            <li>Complies with COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act)</li>
            <li>Shows only family-safe ads approved by Google AdMob's policies</li>
            <li>Does not collect personal information from users of any age</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>We use two third-party services:</p>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Service</th>
                    <th>Purpose</th>
                    <th>Their Privacy Policy</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>Google AdMob</td>
                    <td>Displaying ads</td>
                    <td><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">policies.google.com/privacy</a></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Apple App Store</td>
                    <td>Processing purchases</td>
                    <td><a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">apple.com/legal/privacy</a></td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <h2>Your Rights and Choices</h2>

        <h3>Removing Ads</h3>
        <p>Purchase the ad-free version for $1.99 to stop seeing ads entirely.</p>

        <h3>Deleting Your Data</h3>
        <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device, simply delete the app to remove everything. There's nothing on our end to delete because we don't have your data.</p>

        <h3>Requesting Information</h3>
        <p>We don't collect personal information, so there's nothing for us to provide. If you have questions about what Google or Apple collects, please refer to their privacy policies linked above.</p>

        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>Your study progress is stored locally using Apple's SwiftData framework, which is protected by your device's built-in security features (like your passcode or Face ID). Since we don't transmit or store your data on external servers, there's no risk of a data breach on our end.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this policy from time to time. If we make significant changes, we'll update the "Effective Date" at the top of this page. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>
        <p>For minor changes (like fixing typos), we won't necessarily notify you. For major changes that affect how we handle your information, we'll do our best to let you know through the app.</p>

        <h2>Contact Us</h2>

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>We built PermitReady to help you pass your permit test, not to collect your data. Your study progress stays on your device, we don't track you, and the only third-party service that collects information is Google AdMob (which you can avoid by purchasing the ad-free version). That's our promise.</p>
        <p>Good luck on your test! 🚗</p>
