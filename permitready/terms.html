        <h3>Arbitration Agreement</h3>
        <p>If we cannot resolve a dispute informally within 30 days, you and TechSmog agree that any dispute will be resolved through binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that:</p>

        <p>You agree not to participate in any class action lawsuit or class-wide arbitration related to PermitReady.</p>

        <h3>Jurisdiction</h3>
        <p>If arbitration is not enforceable, you agree that any legal action must be brought in the state or federal courts located in Massachusetts, and you consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of those courts.</p>

        <h2 id="severability">14. Severability</h2>
        <p>If any provision of these Terms is found to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.</p>
